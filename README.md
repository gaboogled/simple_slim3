# Slim 3 MVC Framework Skeleton Application

## Summary
_______________________________________________________________________________
Use this skeleton application to quickly set up and start working on a new Slim Framework 3 MVC structured application. This application uses the latest Slim 3 with Plates PHP template renderer (league/plates) to replicate Views and render templates within Slim 3. It also uses a series of other Composer packages with plumbing in place to kickstart your new MVC PHP project.

## Case Statement

At times, business trends, product requirements,  and process policies within Non-Agile environments can lack the flexibility necessary to enforce complex development methodology processes and policies.  Environments adopting Agile approaches require agile development processes.

The slim3mvc Skeleton is a Slim 3 Skeleton Application based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) development structures, commonly used Agile Software Development.

The goal is to aid in the early stages of the development process by leveraging Slim 3's lightweight footprint while empowering reusability approaches that better support the separation of logic from business, functional, and presentation dependencies using modular and reusable components.

The main idea is to utilize a specific set of Composer Packages compatible with the Slim 3 micro-Framework to construct an MVC structured development workflow consisting of requirements, modeled as components or widgets, that are then selected from a policy-based library to support business needs.

## Install Slim 3 MVC Application

>**WARNING:** This is a Composer Skeleton Application. Installation will overwrite existing composer.json files if run within an existing Slim 3 folder.

To get started, simply

Then run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Slim 3 Framework MVC application. (usually the root of your web server)

 composer install

Next, you'll want to:

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `/public` directory.
* Ensure `/logs` is web writeable. (chmod -R 755 logs)
